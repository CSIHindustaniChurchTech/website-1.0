            <h2>About</h2>
            <p class="lead">
              The "CSI Hindustani Church" located at the premises of "Vishranti
              Nilayam" on Infantry Road Bangalore (within the territorial
              jurisdiction of the Karnataka Central Diocese of The Church of
              South India) is the legacy of Mission Work, started by CEZM- the
              Church of England Zenana Missionary Society more than 160 years
              ago.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              In 1950 the then Bishop of Mysore Diocese, handed over control, of
              the CEZM Women Program and its properties on Infantry Road
              Bangalore, to The Synod of the Church of South India, for its use,
              to accommodate The Head Office of the CSI Women's Order and the
              CSI Women's Fellowship. Interestingly, the Worshiping Community
              regularly meeting for Worship, Prayer and Holy Eucharist at our
              Church Building, remained a part of the Diocese, attached
              pastorally to 'St Paul's Church' located near the entrance of The
              Bowring & Lady Curzon Hospitals Bangalore.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              In the aftermath of the above changes, our Church unfortunately
              suffered the casualty of being neglected for a long time. Although
              extended pastoral care, was provided by the Diocese through
              successive Presbyters of St Paul's Church., namely Rev Logapathi,
              Rev Pramanand,Rev Jacob ect.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              In spite of such difficult times, our Church has survived, with
              the continued attendance and prayers, of a few faithful believers,
              living through the ordeal, for well over the last 84 odd
              years(1934-2017). We all gratefully acknowledging and glorifying
              God bountiful Grace and Mercy in raising our small worshipping
              Community of yester years, into its present stature a vibrant and
              lively congregation reaching out, to a varied section of people,
              from the North, West, East & Central parts of India.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              Church Services are now conducted in the national language
              (Hindi). The contemporary context potentially constitutes a window
              of opportunity for mission & outreach to the REST OF INDIA, in the
              City of Bangalore. The lack of sufficient facilities & resources,
              for pastoral care, and spiritual nurture, of Hindi speaking
              people, especially IT Professionals migrating into the City of
              Bangalore every day. Many of whom (coming from backgrounds,
              affirming the Christian faith) are left wanting, unchurched and
              likely to become dechurched without good Christian fellowship.
